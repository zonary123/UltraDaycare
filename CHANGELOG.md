# Changelog

## [1.2.3]

### Added

- **PokeMMO Time-based Hatching**: Added time-based egg hatching to PokeMMO daycare mode. The hatching speed is configurable globally and supports permission-based durations for VIPs.
- **Egg IV Preview**: Added a visual preview of expected IV ranges/locked stats directly on the breeding button in the Plot Menu when in PokeMMO mode.
- **Egg Hatching Methods**: Added a new configuration option `pokemmoEggHatchMethod` supporting `STEPS`, `TIME`, and `ALL`.
- **Hatching Ability Acceleration**: Supported ability speedups (Flame Body, Magma Armor, Steam Engine) for both steps-based and time-based egg hatching.

### Changed

- **Config Defaults**: Configured `multiplierAbilityAcceleration` to default to `2.0` to speed up hatching times by half.
- **License Update**: Updated project license from "All Rights Reserved" to GPL-3.0-only.

### Fixed

- **Optimized Ticking & Performance**: Avoided duplicate database/LuckPerms permission lookups during the active 1-second ticking task loop.

## [1.2.2]

### 🔧 Fixes

- **Invalid UUID Exception**: Fixed a server crash (`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid UUID string: ???`) that
  occurred when deserializing Pokémon eggs or hatched Pokémon. The system now correctly assigns the player's UUID or a
  fallback nil UUID to the original trainer field instead of a placeholder `"???"` or username string, which are not
  valid UUID format.
- **Menu Cooldowns**: Removed the minimum and maximum limits for cooldown settings when opening menus.

## [1.2.1]

### 🔧 Fixes

- **Breeding Fee in PokeMMO Mode**: Fixed the breed button showing without checking the breeding fee in PokeMMO mode.
  The fee gate now correctly takes priority when `enableBreedingFee` is enabled.
- **Paid Experience Config Ignored**: Fixed claim XP buttons always charging money regardless of the
  `enablePaidExperience` config value. When set to `false`, the claim XP buttons are now hidden entirely.
- **Config Initialization**: Added missing default values for `enablePaidExperience`, `payXpPrice`, and `payXpAmount` in
  the config constructor.

## [1.2.0] - Modular Daycare & PokeMMO Mode

### 🌟 Added

- **Modular Daycare Modes**: Added full support for switching between standard Pokémon passive daycare and active
  PokeMMO-style daycare (where parents are consumed instantly to produce an egg) via `daycareMode` in `config.json`.
- **Extensibility API**: Created `DaycareRegistry` and `DaycareMode` interface so third-party developers can easily add
  and register new gameplay modes.
- **PokeMMO IV Inheritance**: Implemented a specialized PokeMMO IV inheritance formula with stats-locking using braces (
  Power items) and a configurable success percentage (`percentagePowerItem`).
- **Subpackage Mechanics Isolation**: Refactored the codebase to place mode-specific mechanics under `mechanics/pokemon`
  and `mechanics/pokemmo` subpackages, maximizing readability and allowing easy extensibility.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Refactoring

- **Code Reuse Optimization**: Reused identical Pokémon subpackage mechanics within PokeMMO mode to avoid class
  duplication and reduce maintenance overhead.
- **Dynamic Instance Helper**: Introduced `UltraDaycare.getActiveMechanic(Class)` to dynamically query the active mode's
  mechanic instances.
- **Instance-Based Incense Refactor**: Rewrote `DayCareInciense` to hold instance-based incense lists, preventing
  static-field configuration pollution when multiple modes are initialized at startup.
- **Standardized File Reading**: Migrated manual JSON text parsing in `DayCareInciense` to use `UtilsFile`.

### 🔧 Fixes

- **Nature Module**: Fixed a bug where the nature module was not being applied correctly.

## [1.1.1] - Optimizations & Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Fixes

- **Everstone Nature Inheritance**: Refactored Everstone detection during breeding to avoid fragile
  `instanceof CobblemonItem` checks, ensuring reliable nature inheritance.
- **Hatch Null Safety**: Added safety checks in `getEggInfo` to prevent `NullPointerException` crashes when hatching
  eggs with empty nature metadata.
- **Hatch All Command Fixed**: The command to hatch all eggs now works correctly.
- **Improved Hatch Event**: The hatch event now sends information about the resulting Pokémon. This allows mods like
  UltraQuests and UltraEvents to filter and detect when your Pokémon are born, opening up new possibilities for custom
  quests and events.

### ⚡ Performance Improvements

- **Save System Optimization**: The system for saving egg and training data is now even faster and more efficient.
  Changes are applied instantly without slowing down the server.
- **Overall Stability Improvement**: Internal code has been optimized to reduce resource consumption and improve overall
  game fluidity.

## [1.1.0] - UltraDaycare: Automatic Breeding & Dynamic Training

### 🌟 New Features

- **Automatic Breeding**: Eggs now generate automatically in the background! Even better: notifications for new eggs are
  **much faster than before**. No more waiting around to know if the stork has arrived!
- **Step-Based Training System**: Your Pokémon now gain experience while in the Daycare **simply by you walking around
  the world**. Train your team while you explore!
- **Experience Claiming**: We've added dedicated buttons above each Pokémon so you can see how much experience they've
  accumulated and **pay to apply it** instantly.
- **Breeding Costs**: Administrators can now enable a breeding fee, making the server economy more dynamic.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Fixes

- **Max Level Detection**: The menu is now smarter and automatically hides training info once your Pokémon reaches the
  training level cap.
- **Pokemon Selection Fix**: We've fixed the selection menu so you can navigate through all pages of your PC and Party
  without any issues.
- **Better Performance**: Optimized the internal engine so data saving and menu opening are instantaneous and don't
  affect gameplay fluidity.
